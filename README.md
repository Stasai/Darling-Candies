### Small project to practice skills with HTML and CSS

This project is generally for pratice in the field of HTML and CSS.

I am learning and using Tailwind for the CSS side of things.
In terms of JS, it's only used for basic functionality and I am using ChatGPT 3.5 along with it.

Some text in this project is generated by ChatGPT 3.5 because it's faster and I can barely think of generic text to put in there.
